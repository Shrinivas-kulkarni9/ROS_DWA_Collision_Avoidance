This is a simple project in which I have implemented a publisher subscriber model for collision avoidance in ROS. It will run on Gazebo. 
What is novel about the project is the way I generated a map of the environment via SLAM. doing it the normal was is tedious, and hence I set obstacles in such a way that the collision avoidance script would take care of covering the whole environment.
I used this MAP to test the DWA path planning algoritm, and the resultant video can be found in the repo.
Cheers!
